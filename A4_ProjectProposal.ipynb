   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "    There are several confounds and biases in our data sources and analyses. We will first start with our data sources. For one, most of our datasets- with a few exceptions- simply tell us where an amenity is located. The mere existence of an amenity, however, does not necessarily translate to how valuable the amenity is. That is, it does not inform us how often the resource is used by the community, how well-managed the resource is, and how the resource compares to other resources similar to it. For example, there may be three colleges in a single city, but that may not be as beneficial as having one college (with significantly higher educational standards) in a single city. To alleviate this concern we do try to limit our analyses to well-recognized brands (such as Starbucks, Walmart, and McDonalds) when examining consumerism. All three stores have consistent quality standards across their franchises. Our focus on uniformity, on the other hand, does also raise a different pitfall. There may be some local mom-and-pop stores, for example, which are widely popular in the area but that we do not include in our data. Additionally, stores like Starbucks and Walmart are more likely to congregate in a larger city where there is an increased foot traffic than in a smaller town. While the biases that results from looking at larger chains is not desirable, it is not hugely problematic. We never do claim that Starbucks is to represent all coffee shops or that Walmart is to reprsent all grocery stores in a community. We limit our correlation results to that between the crime rate and the frequency of that particular store. While that may not be as encompassing as we desire, it still does yield a question of interest.\n",
    "    As for our analyses, one pitfall is that we treat cities as independent entities. In other words, when we examine crime in a city, we only examine the amenities in that very same city. We do not look at the amenities of neighboring cities or those in the same county when deriving our results. The drawback is that there may be resources which are in actuality shared among nearby cities, so that multiple cities benefit from them. As it is difficult to take accessibility and openess of an amentiy into account, we do hope that this trickle over effect is minor. Also, amenities are not a standalone variable but are influenced by other factors, which include the people themselves and how much crime is present in a city to begin with.\n",
    "    We are confident that at the very least we will be able to determine the correlation coefficient values between the crime rate and every amenity and generate scatter matrices for each amenity. If our hypothesis is wrong and our end result is that there is little to no correlation for every single amenity, then we will still present those results. Having weak correlation coefficients (while maybe not the most exciting conclusion) is still a valid one. We will, however, reevaluate and try to understand why the results turned out the way they did. If necessary, we may also look to more traditional measures of crime rates (such as educational level) and see how that is correlated with the crime rate and then in turn see how that is correlated with the presence of amenities in a given city."
